Deborah, good morning, good night. Good morning. Who is at night? Ah, for Vlad. Why do you do this to yourself? Isn't there a better time? Or did you get assigned to this? I'm night person. I love night classes. It's just amazing. Great, great. I could never. This is now my earliest class of the day. Oh yeah, because the difference is like two hours or not. Is it 7.30? Correct. It's 7.30 because India has like weird time zone. You're in India, right? Funny story. I'm back in Chicago. Right. Yeah, that's what I thought. Hi Professor Burkhart. Hi. Way back in Chicago. I'm confused. What happened? Oh my, it's a big story. It's a really long story. Okay. No problem. Joanna, good to see you guys. How was it with Prof. Doering? I watched the video. It seemed good. Okay. Yes, yes, yes. What's new? How are we doing? Living the dream or some version? I'm forgetting that Christmas is coming. Less than two months. Yeah, less than two months. It's right around the corner. Oh, well, wish me luck that I can teach CPA or PCA 10 minutes after waking up. It'll be a good one. I think you'll like this session. Euben, where are you? I like their lighting. That's pretty. Oh, are we ready to turn in this assignment? Vlad, I just saw your email. That is the correct structure. Guys, we re-sort of specified in the assignment. It's very, very specific. So just follow exactly what it has, the one through eight, which is regarding correlation and the market analytics. And then the second part will be you discussing essentially your segmentation strategy, but you're going to do it by answering all of the questions that are there. So make sure you really take that deep dive. As you see, there's really only one HC and there are three LOs. So make sure you're hyper-focusing on those three LOs. Giovanna. I just wanted to say something for the class. So I'm part of study kit this semester and we're trying to do like a prototype event. And one of the things that we're testing is a headstart type of event in which we just start the assignment. And we were going to do this like one week before the deadline, but since it didn't work, I want to invite everyone to join us like in starting like cramming one hour of just like planning the outline for this assignment. So like, I'm going to text everyone in the group chat to see like what's the best day, but please, please, please come. This is exciting. Cool. Very cool, Giovanna. Yes. So watch out for her communication. Feel free to support. I love it. That's cool, Giovanna. All right, my friends, let's hop in, take that deep dive. So today we're talking, this is itty bitty. I hope you can see this. The LOs for today are correlation, market analytics and research strategy. What we're going to be doing is taking the deeper dive into perceptual mapping. And then in the second activity, I have a series of slides that I'm going to take you through to really look at how we uncover that latent structure in data vis-a-vis PCA. And hopefully if the readings were not clear, which it's quite technical in terms of the analytical way of approaching PCA, we'll get clear on what it actually means and how it looks on graphs. So hopefully that will be really helpful and insightful for you. So starting with this, let's see if I can do this. Okay, very itty bitty. But essentially this is the perceptual map from Apple and Chazelle. I'll ask you to jump in. Perceptual map is one tool that we use. How do you sort of explain a perceptual map? And how did Steve Jobs, little video clip that I asked you to watch, play into that? So perceptual map is actually used to visualize how consumers perceive the position of the products or the brands in the market, which is often in relation to the competitors. And how Steve Jobs did it was he, I think the attributes were how smart he was and the price of the thing, if I'm not wrong. Let's try to do this. Yeah, so what it was, he actually tried to highlight the market gap that Apple had identified. And also it's useful to guide the new product team and the new product team and the marketing team. And he was like, one of the reasons he did this was to help businesses visualize Apple's marketing position in the eyes of the consumers and how the key attributes that Apple present differentiate them from their competitors in the smartphone industry. That's well explained. That's well explained. Yeah, in essence, it's hashtag a data viz tool. Is that not? For the reasons you just mentioned, you've been. Oh, I really like what you just said. I just wanted to quickly add that I think it was not cost, but it was rather the ease of use in devices and the smartness of the device. So Apple was trying to take a leap from traditional market where the market was providing either of those things, but then Apple tried to take both. Right. And seemed really so simple in terms of what he was pushing, but he did it in such a almost calm sort of Silicon Valley-ish simple way that it made the impact. So I want you to consider that. You'll use perceptual maps going forward. In fact, I would say out of my 11 capstone students, nearly all of them are creating at least some portion of a biz plan, and nearly all of them are incorporating some sort of perceptual map in that. It communicates a lot in a very simplistic way. So yeah, pay close attention. And specifically as it relates to PCA and how we can demonstrate some really complex concepts vis-a-vis perceptual maps. Okay, cool. Let's hop right into the prep poll, get started with this fun thing, and then we'll take a deeper dive. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. you you you one minute you you one minute a minute your Okay, got everyone's. All right. So in essence, eigenvalue explains the amount of variance that's captured in an eigenvector. And why is it important? It's important because it shows you which component explains the structure of your data best. Okay. So in addition to what I just said, will someone try to help explain what that means in real terms? And feel free to try out your response if you think it was pretty accurate based on what I just said. Georgi. Okay. So let's imagine that we have data that has like n number of variables that can be let's say 50, 100. So we cannot visualize that in any way that is meaningful to us. The most we can probably visualize is three to four variables using the method that we've shown in pre-classwork. But instead, we can sort of crunch those variables down into fewer dimensions. So from 100 or 50 variables that we have, we can crunch them down to like let's say two or three variables. By finding eigenvectors, sort of by using linear algebra to modify the vector space to find the dimensions that explain the most of those variables. So in other words, so let's say we had 50 of those dimensions or variables that we used. It's possible for us to find one dimension that explains more of these variables in it. So if something had a high value along that dimension, it would indicate that let's say it had a high value across 30 or 40 of those dimensions. So rather than us, sure, this would lose a lot of information. Maybe not a lot. Sometimes we lose a lot of information, but it would be useful for us to visualize it. So to do that, we calculate a covariance matrix in between all of these variables, okay? And we look for how much which would tell us if it's a high number, if it's a positive number, tell us that these two variables in that, sorry. Congratulations to yourself. Proceed. I'm sorry. These two variables varies together, meaning that if one increases, the other one increases as well. So once we calculate this for this covariance matrix between all of these variables, we can now calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of each of these, of each of these two combinations. And now we sort them in a descending order based on those eigenvalues. Eigenvalue, as we said, would tell us how much that eigenvector would explain covariance in this entire multidimensional space. And we can, by getting the one with the highest eigenvalue, we essentially get the dimension. Now that's not the same dimension we had. Like the whole dimension space has changed. But this dimension that we got with the highest eigenvalue, this eigenvector that points in some direction, would explain the most of that data. So that single variable that we got would explain literally, even just across a single dimension, would explain all of those data to the greatest possible extent. And then we can take, let's say, top K of them, top three, for example, and visualize that data nicely. And we would be able to sort of crunch that down to smaller dimensions and explain what the best way is. Georgia, nice stab there. Very exhaustive. That was very helpful. Yubin. I don't think there's anything mathematically and conceptually to add after that amazing explanation. But I was thinking of a very simple example to illustrate what Georgia has been saying for the past three minutes. So basically, I was thinking of an example of a sunglass frame. So there might be various components that a frame might think about. For example, it could think about price, style, the amount of UV protection the sunglasses provide, and other things. And if we say we're to do a principal component and conduct the eigenvector for each, then let's say that we have like 1.8, 1.3, and then 0.8 respectively for each component. And we would say that the component that has the highest eigenvalue would account for first in our data set. So if price has 1.8 eigenvalue, and that's the highest, then we could say that that explains most of our consumer behavior over others. That's a great illustration in the sunglass example, using the features. We will do that in activity, too. We're actually going to be looking at cars in the market as another. I like that a lot. Mohamed, last with you. Can I touch on the mathematical calculation for eigenvalue? Take it away. OK, so... I love this whole process of nerding out and how the class is just jumping right into this. Well, so that in the past, usually classes just want to sort of quickly move on because it's so overwhelming. So proceed. Yeah, so as Durja and Durbin mentioned, if we have difference points in the plot and we have this principal component, we basically make a projection from these points onto this principal component and then take the average of the sum of the squared values of this distance to the center. So from the projection to the center, we calculate this distance, then squared and take the average. And the highest sum for all these values will be the highest eigenvalue, which is for the principal component. Yes, nice addition. Wow. All three of you. That was an excellent explanation of what we're talking about and really helping us dissect, illustrate, you know, add with some of this mathematical piece, Mohamed, in a really helpful way. Good work, everybody. OK, so let's hop in. We're going to look at the utility of perceptual mapping. So we kicked it off with sort of that famous perceptual map. Shown us by Steve Jobs when he unveiled that first product that's changed our lives completely. And now you have the chance to cut your teeth with what you did in the pre-class work in demonstrating some of your perceptual maps and justifying the usage of it. Now, this is, you know, sad for some, very happy for others. This is the last session in our analytical unit. We next transition to strategy. So I'm happy that you've had a sort of brief exploration of some of the quantitative tools that we can utilize. And I'm glad you've enjoyed it for some of you. And then we make that transition to strategy. And it's actually my favorite part of B110. So you'll be able to deploy some of these analytical techniques that you've utilized, coupled with kind of the introduction where we got really clear on consumer behavior, customer centricity, spoke about briefly segmentation. And then we'll all sort of put it into play in a larger sort of macro analysis of strategy. But with this last session, we're now going to speak to the perceptual map. So what we're going to do is we're going to bring up some of your maps. We're going to critique your classmates maps and then we'll vote on which one was your favorite. OK, so let's start with this. And because I'm such a kind professor, I'm going to, which is sort of not characteristic of me, I'm actually going to ask for a volunteer who is so proud of their perceptual map that you'd like us to. Well, that was a quick volunteer, Vlad, that you'd like us to help you look at this and maybe critique it as well. Vlad, drop it in. So context, I went to the store and I said, milk, but not from cow, please. I looked at four alternatives. You see them, sorry, five different options. They're on the map. These are Argentinian alternative milks. So like non-animal based milks. And the two dimensions are price and the sensation of whether they actually feel and taste like cow milk. I like this. OK, I mean, this is resonating with many of you. I'm sure we have some vegans in the virtual room. OK, so let's look at this. Vladislav, what's making sense about this? What would you perhaps do differently? I'm not sure how you can, like, call milk like sensation is very weird metric. Like, I guess very different people that have like different understanding of what it means. So yeah, I'm not sure about like X axis. OK, Kyren. Oh, actually, Vlad, do you want to respond to that? And then Kyren. Sure. Yeah, there is one way to chemically look at it. Like just chemically how similar they are in terms of causing a certain sensation because there is a ton of research on it. And second is just surveys. You can survey like a representative population, which they did in LATAM, like not co-specifically like the one at the top, right? They did this survey and they tested the sensations of their alternative milks. And they asked people like, it was blind. Like they just gave people milks and they're like, how close does it resemble a regular cow milk? And then people responded. So there were studies on that. OK, interesting. I'm glad that's backed in some scientific research. If you were to put an LO on what that study did to enhance your perceptual map, Vlad, what would that LO be? Transfer of behavior, I think, maybe, or market. Yeah, definitely. Kyren, next. I think it's, I don't know if I'm understanding the y-axis correct. That going up is the lowest price, but going down is the highest price, right? So isn't it interesting how the one with the lowest price has the highest, or is it like kind of sideways, is the sensation to how milk like, it's on this side. So the lowest price has the highest milk sensation. Cow to milk. I think that's interesting, as you'd expect. The ones that are more expensive, like Moac has been put to make them taste as close to milk as possible, unless I'm understanding. Yeah. OK, quickly responding to this. Imagine you're an average Argentinian with an average income of about $200 per month. What is the best option for you? The most expensive milk or the cheapest milk? What do you prefer? So that's why I put lowest price at the top, because that will be more preferred, and there'll be like a broader consumer base preferring that because they'll be more likely to afford it. So price is just one of the affordability factor. Like it's more affordable. I think I should call it affordability instead, but yeah, it's not very straightforward. OK, maybe rename that. But I do like the logic. Kiron, does that satisfy, or is there still a bit of confusion seeing it in the face? No, I think it checks out. OK, it checks out. Glad you check out. OK, Priti. Yeah, I have like a tiny recommendation using hashtag customer centricity for the Y-axis specifically. So if we analyze a lot of vegan product markets, we tend to see that for beef burgers and patties, impossible burger supposed to perfectly almost replicate beef versus beyond burger is not supposed to do that. So we are looking at customers within the vegan market that want a perfect replacement for an existing dairy based product or want something completely different. And that depends on their ethos of whether they care about finding a meat replacement and still want to satisfy that urge and craving, or if they just want to completely cut off any dairy sensation. So maybe he can reword non cow milk like sensation to be like cow milk replacement, non cow milk replacement, and maybe that captures sentiment more succinctly. I think that's a beautiful nuance bringing in Vlad's response. Yeah, I think it goes deeply into segmentation because it's indeed, these are two completely different segments. One is regular plant-based milk where people can do oat-based milk or like something else or coconut, or like it doesn't really matter versus the specific segment of people who want to eat non animal-based products, but that resemble the specific animal-based product taste. That's a more narrow segment than for them. The mapping would be a bit different. Yeah, thank you for that. Yes, yes, yes. To clarify though, I don't know necessarily if they're different segments because segments are really determined based on not only consumer behavior, but different sort of psychographical, demographical aspects of that particular group. I think they're still the same group. They may just prefer different features and products, right? But still that is an important nuance to identify in terms of customer preference with regards to that. Perfect, anyone else? Yubin, did you still have a comment or question? Mine is very like a minor comment, but I was thinking about data-based. Maybe it's just me, but I noticed that all the circles have like a black line around it, but then because not the color, the background color of the circle is black, it seems like it has a different shape. So to users, it might confuse them because oftentimes size of their bubbles also represent another variable. Like it could be like a market cap or something else, like the share volume. So it might be worth, like it's a very small thing, but it might be worth showing the background color if you're not going to see really specific that the size is all same and it's showing the same thing. I love that. Generally bringing that in, Yubin, if you can provide sort of a third piece of differentiation in the size or the color of the bubble, what would it, with regards to what Vlad's created here, what would you bring in? Not necessarily market cap, but right, that was just one example you provided, but what would you bring in that would be helpful? I'll let Vlad respond to that, Vlad. When I was doing the research, I was thinking market share of in the Argentinian plant-based milk. And I was thinking NotCo was the greatest, so I thought to make it the biggest, but also I chose these colors because of their brand colors. So NotCo is black and white, Kiki is blue, light blue. So that's why I chose these colors. And I, yeah, I didn't think about the black lining and it should be consistent. But yeah, I was thinking either market share or yeah, that's what seemed the most apparent to me to include for some. I think market share could definitely be one. And I appreciate your thoughtfulness in creating those colors based on brand association. But yeah, that could be one. I can think of a few others. Yubin, what did you have in mind? Yeah, so kind of connecting to, so in my freshman year, I conducted a research about what leads people to about vegan practices. And I did a study against like Korean audiences. And based on that result, it showed that a lot of people, at least in Korea, like drank these vegan products because of environmental, like sustainability purposes. So maybe if that is also the reason for Argentinian milk, like Argentinian audience, it might be worth representing the bubble size as environmental impact, like what kind of emphasis they put on sustainability and besides to represent how much initiative they do with it. That seems very aligned with the segment. I like that a lot. Teddy likes it as well. Good stuff, okay. You'd wanna take a bit of a deeper dive like Vlad has done in terms of LATAM, just to ensure that that still resonates with that particular segment in that particular region. But yes, good point. Well done, Vlad. Good questions, good pushback, classmates. Let's get another volunteer for a second perceptual map. Drop it below Vlad's. Vladislav, is that you volunteering? Perfect, drop it in. We've got a Vlad theme here. Vlad and Vlad. Not Vlad and Vlad, Vlad and Vlad. Okay, that's actually from pitch tech of project I worked in a few years ago. Yeah. Cool, speak to it. Yeah, so it was about inter-gathering systems and the point was that our competitors had low density compared to our product and had not as much functionality, like remote control and other stuff. So yeah. Very cool. Okay, anything else you wanna do in terms of explaining what you've dropped into this graph? I mean, I guess I need to kind of explain like the market itself. So like indoor gardening is like devices that people buy into like grow some veggies or like daily consumption. Also some restaurants have them. Yeah, and so like three major players out there. Yeah, so they're listed here and that's it. I'm curious, did you launch your product? I'm here, so no. You can be here and launch, but fair enough. That's hilarious. Yes, that's hilarious. Okay, I like it, it's pretty. So who wants to jump in? Offer a critique, some sort of question, Mohamed. Yeah, I'm just wondering about the terminology to Y-axis, which is functional. Because from my perspective, I just get kind of three definitions for being functional. First one, maybe using the materials or the raw materials will. Second one, make more quantity for the production. And third one, producing more profit. So which kind of functionality are we talking about in the Y-axis? Yeah, nice guesswork with that enumeration. So Vladislav, yeah, how did you define functionality? So as far as I remember, it was more about like features of the product. It could like stack, it could have like, the plan was to do like some AI systems that will like monitor for like diseases and things like that. And like grow a process and like adjust accordingly like number of waters that need to be given to the plant, like sunlight and things like that. So that was like the main point about functionality, just like these cool features, but yeah. Ooh, I like that. So how would you build that into this perceptual map so that the outsider who doesn't have sort of this background context that we're discussing now would more clearly understand what that looked like, Vladislav? You mean like how it should be explained to like in Pidgin or something? Well, how would you refine it on this perceptual map itself? So that just the quick viewer would really quickly understand what you mean by functionality. Okay, I guess it's kind of hard because like it's slide number 11 or 12, something like that. So it's kind of like sort of information that was given before. Oh, okay. Yeah. That's given, so the functionality is clearly defined in earlier slides. Okay, so if you were just to reproduce this perceptual map, perhaps in the key, you would describe how you're operationalizing functionality. Cool. Rishabh, what do you have? Yeah, I think I would maybe replace more and less functional with just features. And then it's like more features, less features that becomes the access. I don't know if that's the right word, but yeah. That was one. The second thing I was thinking about was just in terms of positioning. I feel like just their specific product could be further to the right and to the top, because right now it still feels like another product could go up there, but if they are the industry best then I would position it even further away on the axis. Just from like a visual standpoint. Yes, Vladislav response. I mean, I guess it was more like scale scene just like for it to be like, I don't know, aesthetic or something. So yeah, but I guess it's right point. It can be like more to the corner. Okay, and what about replacing functionality with features as Rishabh's explaining? Does that capture it or is it losing part of what you're trying to catch? I mean, I'm not sure that it can be like, I mean, it's a very difficult question. I guess it's very hard to find correct word for this one. Okay. Shazal next to you or Ali first. Yeah, I think Vlad should have considered pricing as a third feature of the perceptual map because I think the average consumer would look for the pricing of the product, not only the functionality and the destiny. Okay, I like that Ali. So how would you incorporate that into the perceptual map? I think he can put colors or like adjust colors for certain level of prices, or I think he can exchange one dimension of surprises and use a color for this dimension or it's a variable you placed. Okay, Vladislav reactions. I would suggest probably not dropping one of the variables, but rather adding one. And maybe it's in that color gradation, like pink to red or something like that. I would say that actually price is not very good thing to add because like the thing about hardware startups is that you have a lot of up-cost and it means that if you have like very small, like if you produce in small quantities, it's super expensive. And that's why when you like startup and you didn't have a lot of customers, like your prices will be not very, like you can't compete when it comes to prices, like no way. So limitation. Interesting, so it sort of depends on your audience with respect to who's viewing the perceptual map, right? If it's a consumer facing audience, Ali makes an excellent point and that you'd really want to demonstrate that it's an important factor. However, because the costs are so high, fresh would probably be, and a pink to red gradation would be the bright red, right? And so that's not something you wanna showcase. Rather you're sort of de-emphasizing that. Okay, interesting, interesting. Do we have anything else Shazza I'll ask to you? And then I'll ask for a third volunteer to share the perceptual map. Yeah, so I have two questions. How's the density per square meter measured for this product? Is it like the number of plants or like volume of the produce or some other metric? And also how did you decide on the relative distances between the products of the map? Is it like, is the gap between click and grow and AeroGarden the same in terms of functionality as the gap between AeroGarden and the AI Fresh Station? Good questions. Vladislav addresses his first question first. So yeah, density is just like number of plants that you can put in like one square meter of, like people don't have a lot of real estate. So it's kind of like very beneficial to have a lot of stuff in like small number of square meters. But like about scaling, as I said before, I guess it was more like, it wasn't really like accurate scaling because like you can't really measure functionality to be honest. So yeah, I guess Y-axis was problematic. Okay, so how would you solve for that, if at all? Vladislav. I don't know, maybe replace like Y-axis with something or make some sort of scaling, like I don't know, maybe add some data, like I have to say, like just put it, for example, like zero, five, 10 and blah, blah, blah. So just, it would be like more, you could see like how much is different. Yeah. Okay, maybe that would require a separate graph to demonstrate that, important though. And then Chazal has a second question, but Teddy, get your reaction first. It was not a reaction, it was just a thought, like I'm thinking more about the potential customers for this product. I'm thinking that a lot of people who choose to do like, to grow veggies in their house, maybe like grandmas or like my mom, for example, she really likes growing, she has like a small place where she grows like lettuce, tomatoes. So I guess something else to consider could be the user friendliness and how complex it is. And if he has like an app, if he has something like that, I think it might be important for the customers because for example, my grandma would find it very hard if it's like, I don't know, too AI complicated, conducted like managed from an app or something like that, even if she like, she might not even have a smartphone. So yeah, something else to consider, I guess. Yeah, that's an excellent point around customer segmentation, getting clear on that segment. Vladislav, is Teddy's kind of visceral reaction to an assumption around a segment correct? Is that the typical demographic? Not exactly. Like we are actually targeting like people who like, they're like group of people who are very enthusiastic in this and it's more like young people, like 30, 40 who are like, don't like Jimmy O products, who don't like, like people who buy like eco food, you know, who go into like eco stores and things like that. So it's more like younger generation of people and that's why we also had like mobile app and stuff like that, yeah. Okay, so younger demographic, that does make sense, but can you still understand Teddy's points relative to user friendliness? That that still would be an important piece. Yeah, we actually, it's just like what's in previous slides. So yeah. Okay, okay, so just like Ali suggested that maybe a third factor would be price. You could also speak to, you know, easy usability or whatever being a different third factor. Okay, so Shazil, what was your second question? I think he answered both of the questions. Good, good, good. Okay, excellent. Good work, Vladislav. All right, let's have a third volunteer. Wow, those first two volunteers were so quick to respond and now I'm getting nothing. No, I contact everyone's like, if I make eyes with professors, she'll definitely call me and I don't want that. Come on, who's the third before I have to cold call? Oh, three, two, one. Okay, Trin, drop yours in. Yes, so can I screen a little bit? So it might take a little bit of time to put the image or I can share link. Yeah, you can share the link. You can share a link or take a screenshot while you explain. Okay. Giovanna, that's hilarious. Your grandma's the party girl. You've swapped roles in life. Okay. Okay, Trin, explain. I'm analyzing different coffee chains that are available in Argentina. So we have Starbucks, which is a more international change and some of the, I think, pretty well-known, which is Havana and Cafe Martinez. And there's a smaller change, which is more cafe that is more like a cafe. So I'm trying to explain. So there's a smaller change, which is more cafe that are more aiming for higher customers who enjoy more luxurious ambience. And for the access, I have the quality of coffee and high availability. Most of them are just based on my perceptions and the size of the coffee. So the bigger the bigger the prices are, the more. Sorry, Trin, your audio was just cutting out on that last part. Can you repeat that last piece of explanation? Yeah, it's just a circle which represents the price of the coffee. So the bigger it is, the more highly priced the coffee is. Okay, I'm glad you incorporated that. So is your color coding similar to what Vlad did? Related to brand or just fun colors? I think it's just brand. Okay, good stuff. Giovanna, let's have you jump in first. And then Devraj, I want you to identify a second critique or suggestion for an improvement. Giovanna? I just have a clarifying question. I don't really understand what like Cripturing means by high availability or convenience. Is it like how many branches, how many physical stores are there? Like at least in one place in Buenos Aires or like? Yeah, I was thinking like the presence of the stores, like how many stores there are kind of, how frequent they are. Okay, okay, so how could you incorporate that Trin? And just like with Vladislav, I was asking him, you know, for the outside viewer to quickly understand how you've operationalized. What would you incorporate? I guess I would try to change the wording a little bit. For example, like presence of stores or numbers. Get a sense of what you understand. Okay, okay, so change the wording a bit. Maybe even add in, you know, a key, something that's helpful to specify. Cool, Devraj next. I guess my biggest critique is like one of my critiques is about audience. This is a really good start. I think one thing I would do differently is for availability and convenience. I would consider who it's convenient for. For instance, if money is no concern, then it would be available to a wide majority of the population. However, if money is of concern, then perhaps pricing also applies to convenience and availability because certain people might be priced out of the availability of Starbucks coffee, but they might have access to more coffee, let's say, even though it might be geographically a little bit further. So I think getting a little bit more specific with the availability variable and defining like perhaps a sub variable and who that is, like who this graph is for would help increase the strength of it. Train reaction. Yeah, I think I agree. I think the wording can be... Yeah, sorry, your audio is coming in and out a little bit. Again, Devraj, excellent point. Remember the Starbucks case where we identified two very different segments and one trying not to cannibalize the other, but again, being clear on hashtag audience, which segment are you speaking to in demonstrating with this perceptual map and therefore incorporating that in a real way dependent on whichever segment you're choosing. Giovanna. Yeah, I just kind of also want to tap base on personal experience. Thinking about the culture here, like coffee, and I don't know if like how to add this, but more of like what are people doing in that cafes? Like are people working or are they just, I don't know, going there to read books? Because I'm a huge fan of cafe Martinez. I go there like every time. And people from B111 knows this because we did the sprint there. But a lot of the people there are more like reading, like they're older people and they're like reading a book or like reading the newspaper. And then I was wondering how we can also add that feature of like what's, because we're comparing like different coffee brands that have like, I guess, different intentions, at least with customers. So I guess that is also related to segmentation. Yeah, definitely. It's just kind of echoing what Devraj is speaking to, getting clear on which of those segments is that the leisurely crowd who's there for that, which is was essentially Starbucks core target segment. But increasingly now it's focused on the price conscious, fast paced consumer who's there for the quick coffee. Right, so getting clear on that. But Trin, very nice start. Thank you so much. All right, so what you're doing now is you're voting on which was your favorite based on informative nature of it and explain why we had Vlad, we had Vladislav and we had Trin. Okay, explain why if you have not yet. Okay, closing the poll in one minute. All right, please submit. Good stuff. All right. Okay, submit now. Closing the poll. All right, looks like we had everyone represented here. I'd love to hear from Sherry. Sherry, why did you choose Vladsma? Oh, Sherry can't hear you. She's trying to come back. Use different color coding, clear representation, different brands. Oh yeah, can hear you now. Go ahead. Sorry. I chose Vladsma. I chose Vladsma because it's a lot more clear. I chose Vladsma because it's a lot more clear. I chose Vladsma because it's a lot more clear. I chose Vladsma because it's a lot more clear. I chose Vladsma because it's a lot more clear. I chose Vladsma because it's a lot more clear. I chose Vladsma because it's a lot more clear. I chose Vladsma because it's a lot more clear. I chose Vladsma because it's a lot more clear. I chose Vladsma because it's a lot more clear. I chose Vladsma because it's a lot more clear. I think that as people commented, I didn't, for example, I didn't, for example, if you say, for transgraft, they were talking about convenience, and Dheeraj said that if it includes price, for example, then it doesn't become more convenient to your audience depending on who they are. I think, as Giovanna suggested, it would have been more beneficial if the convenience was more clear in terms of, is it just geographically convenient or does it include other factors as well? And then, yeah. Okay, Giovanna? Sorry, I interpreted the question differently. Which perceptron map was the most informative? I was thinking more like, how can we derive meaning from it? And so I was thinking, maybe I'm reading too much in between the lines, but I see a clear argument here that the more branches there are of coffee, the less of a quality it is. It's almost like implying, saying that more handmade, more homemade type of coffee is better because there's going to be less branches. And so I was thinking more how perceptron maps are more, they convey a certain argument about consumers that is slightly different from simply the visual orientation of it. So I don't know if I was, I extrapolated this question a bit, but I was thinking more about the actual meaning and the implicit arguments that we can get from these maps. I like that. Yeah, there's definitely larger implications in selecting what is selected. And it hopefully leads to other discussions as well. Right? If that's in a deck that you're pitching to investors as Vladislav had, or if that's to, you know, an unveiling of a new product line, as it was in the case of Steve Jobs. I'm sure those implications certainly are there. All right, guys, good job. We're going to move into activity two. We don't have too much time for it, but I do want to give it sufficient time to do a quick I-Rest break. I'd like you to do this grounding exercise with me. I want you to think about five things that you're either seeing now or that you have seen today. I want to identify five things you've seen or are seeing now. Four things you hear. It's raining outside. You can hear the raindrops dropping onto the window sill. Four things you hear. Three things you smell or have smelled today. Two things you touch. Touching my tabletop. Feet are touching the carpet. What are you touching? Or what have you touched? Two things. And last, one thing you taste or have tasted today. All right, tapping into your senses there. I hope that was helpful for you. Okay, so let's have you all back, please. using this PCA to uncover the latent structure in the data. This is further to what we began to explore in the pre-class work. We're going to illustrate it with a car example. Hopefully for those of you this was less clear, it will become more clear. Do we have everybody back? Okay, I think most of you are back now. All right, let's get started. So we're going to discuss a perceptual map of car browns, okay, and what we need to be prepared to do here is to apply insights from the readings to this database. So we're going to walk through these slides and I'm going to ask certain focus questions about them. So the first question, Undraal, is this. What is the general trend that is illustrated in the perceptual map? I think it's going from like the left downside to the right top side. So it's like low quality or price and it's going up to a high quality and high price. And I guess it's comparing these different car brands in terms of their like how affordable they are and how high quality they are. Okay, definitely. And could we say that essentially price and quality are highly correlated based on what you just said? Based on this graph I think so, yeah. Okay, Vlad. Yeah, the trend is oval or like kind of oval if you were to draw the oval around it. I think we can actually even do that to show that there are almost no car brands. Okay, there are no car brands actually at all on this graph that are high quality and low price and very high price and very low quality. Those are just not in the picture for obvious reasons because nobody would produce that. It's impossible. Okay, Ali. Yeah, I think quality might be a superficial variable here. I think quality might include many things such as performance, fuel efficiency, how the materials used in the car. So I think it should be more specific here. Fair enough, fair critique. Georgia, I'll have you hop in with response. Also want to ask you how many factors there would be if we performed a PCA on this data and why? Yeah, so that's exactly what I wanted to mention. So if you, like this is a good example because it's really easy to visualize. We only have two dimensions right now, price and quality, and we can if you draw the line as someone did that would that sort of shows how a single line could predict both of these variables. So you could literally crunch this down to a single from two to a single dimension and have only a single axis where a high would indicate a high price and a high quality and a low value and sorry low value in this dimension indicate a low quality and a low price. Okay, I mean essentially we're obtaining two factors right because there are two dimensions in the data but would both factors, Kyren, be equally important? This is a tough question. Would both factors be equally as important? What do you think, Kyren? I think this is more related to the correlation of both factors. If both factors mean they're high price and high quality, if the correlation between them is extremely high then they're both very important but maybe not equally. Okay, you're right. You're correct on half of that. There is high correlation so that tells us something but the answer is actually no. And why is that the case, Mohamed? So I'm not sure if this will address the question but I think we can calculate the loading score which is a proportion for each variable and by calculating this we can know how the linear combination of the variables if we also draw the perpendicular line it's kind of there is a difference between the variance here and the variance here. So if the variance is different comparing of these two axes it means that it's actually no. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're going to get to part of that next. Good job. The answer is essentially no because one of the factors would account for almost all of the variance. Why is that? Because the two variables, price and quality, are very correlated. So the next question is how could you represent the eigenvector that captures the most variance on this graph? And it looks like someone's already crafted that. So what do we see here? This is plotted in orange, right? So the next question here is how could you represent that eigenvector's eigenvalue on this graph? These are the perpendicular lines. Let's have you draw these, Euben. Are you asking about how we could draw the variances from the line? Well, I just want you to show us on the graph. Draw the perpendicular lines and what you're trying to do is you're trying to find, run from the eigenvector to the data points, right? Yeah, I just drew the green lines. I think, well, I tried to draw the orthogonal line. Basically, I think the objective is to draw a straight line from that vertical line and then that would represent the variances. And that vector itself would be the eigenvector and the eigenvalue would be the weighted based on that vector. Okay, correct. So, I mean, just let me remind you that this is the variance along the eigenvector. How long the orange eigenvector is, it's not the distance from the eigenvector or how long the red arrow lines are. That determines which eigenvector accounts for the most variance. So, how would you represent second eigenvector? Riti? Can you draw that on our line? Or Ali, feel free to take a stab. I think it should be perpendicular on the initial eigenvalue. Show us. Okay. Okay. Nice. Okay. So, that's really helpful. So, what does this tell us? It can be informative to represent all the eigenvectors and values on one graph. Why is that the case? Mohamed, did you have a hand raised? Go ahead. Yeah, I was just about to ask a question. Can I ask it before answering the question? Sure. Because it's kind of... Yeah, so isn't it a must that we should draw this line going through or passing through the origin point? Or it could be intercepting to the y-axis? Because I'm kind of confused here why it's not passing through the origin and while calculating the eigenvalue, we are actually getting the projections that you've been doing and the distance to the origin, not to the specific point of this line. So, how can I get this distance? It's a good question. It'll be answered in a few slides. So, just hold off on that. Dhevaraj, did you want to hop in? Professor, just to reiterate your question, it was how the eigenvalues can help us process this data better. Okay. So, for instance, if we're a car industry executive, can I draw on the graph as well? Please. Okay. So, let's say that we're working for infinity. And right now, infinity is perceived as low quality and high price. So, it's a little bit above the x-axis when it comes to just simply where it is on the graph. But let's say that we have a target now. We want to get it below and get much higher quality and keep the price point consistent. We can try moving it over here and then have this represent that eigenvalue. And then that gives us a way that we can work backwards to reverse engineer some sort of goals that the company needs to achieve to increase the quality of their product while maintaining the same price point. Excellent suggestion. Very applicable in the real world. Love this. Okay. So, what do you see here? What do we see here? Jorge, what's going on? Okay. So, in theory, we can have as many PC, the components as we have variables. But that wouldn't be quite as useful here. In this case, we've done that. So, we have two components, which is equal to the same number of variables. So, right now, what we've actually done is we've just changed the vector space a bit. So, these are exactly the same components that we've had up so far. So, with the first principal component, which was the x-axis, we've changed the x-axis component, which was the one that goes like this diagonally. And that told us sort of that was the best variable that, well, that was the best vector component that gave us sort of the best data that we could have had with just a single component. But however, some of the things that it didn't account for was, for example, if you look at infinity, that was the one that had a relatively higher price with a relatively lower quality, meaning that we lost that information with just having a single component. We didn't know, okay, this is actually deviated kind of. Like, infinity kind of deviates from that data. And we didn't know really that it was sort of... It is kind of an exception because you would assume it would be where Citroën is with low quality and sort of like lower quality and lower price, but actually it had almost the same quality as the Citroën, but a higher price than it. So, for us not to lose that information, we added another component, which is orthogonal, meaning that it's uncorrelated to the first component. And we could now show that information as well. So, now we can actually see how far infinity is on that perpendicular axis. And it would actually contain that information. We would now be able to say, okay, this is actually sort of deviates from this trend. So, essentially, and we can do this for as many variables as we have. We can just keep on adding these orthogonal ones and they would be the next best principle components. And by adding each new one, we would be giving in more information that would be sort of similar to the true data. Excellent explanation there, George Devaraj. Has a lot of real world implications here. Now, Mohamed, sort of going back to that bit of confusion. To make this visualization more readable, we can actually rotate it so that it's oriented with eigenvector one as what? The x-axis, eigenvector two as your y-axis. And so, when we look at this, it has a lot of important sort of applications. Briti, I'm going to ask you, is this actually a useful map? It is a useful map because it really helps capture the orthogonality of the principle component one and two. And we can see how the data varies. So, we can clearly see what the amount of noise is based on PC1, PC2, and the line itself helps summarize the data. So, we're seeing a clear correlation between price and quality. Yeah. I think it does capture all the things you're mentioning and it helps illustrate exactly what PCA is trying to do. But Vlad, on kind of a larger level, is it helpful? I mean, if price and quality are highly correlated, you brought this up at the beginning and Ali spoke to it as well. Does it really tell us anything? It tells us the deviation from the mean. So, it tells us which ones are clear outliers. And this way, it's just easier to perceive that, for example, Infinite or Toyota are definitely more outliers compared to the first orange eigenvector. True, true. But also, to me, it's less helpful because – and you spoke to this earlier – but it's unlikely consumers want to purchase something low quality and high price. And it's difficult for companies to produce something that's high quality and low price. So, maybe we're asking the wrong questions. This goes back to what we were talking about earlier with regards to survey research. And sometimes, it's about the questions we ask. So, while PCA is clearly demonstrated here, does it really yield to us what we need it to? Dhevaraj had some really good points about the implications of this. Dhevaraj, I'll come back to you. What would you say would be a better set of questions to ask when developing a new car? Not necessarily around price and quality. How can you make it timeless? Okay. Explain. So, I mean, this is kind of a biased answer and it's not going to be related to business. I just love cars. And for me, the cars that I love the most and the cars that have built the most brand value over time are cars that have been historically timeless. So, I'm thinking about cars like the McLaren F1, the Bugatti Veyron, cars that have just broken the mold for what's doable, and cars that have just had traditionally beautiful design, and cars that people tend to like look back at when they walk out of it. And they get excited every time they twist the key. So, if we're just making like forgetful, boring appliances, like there's a huge market for that. But as like a car lover, I'd rather drive something that makes me feel a certain type of way every time I drive, because life is too short to drive boring cars. That's a great pitch around style. You'd love my friend, Frank Stevenson. When I emceed to NASA's across industry summits, we brought him in as a keynote speaker. He has designed some of the most timeless cars, and he actually utilizes biomimicry in his design process for all the reasons you just said. Kairan, what else would you incorporate here? I mean, we have a lot. We have comfort, safety, miles per gallon. I think like maintenance and how expensive the spare parts are. Because for most people, like now when you buy a car, like, friends, it's nice. But some people like the car, if it's too, maybe if it argues you can't buy a car, you can't maintain. But like, for example, Toyota's are relatively not expensive. But in terms of like spare parts, we tend to have relatively cheaper ones. So like the idea of how expensive is it to maintain the vehicle as well, really does factor in the long term for people. Definitely, definitely. Last to you Vladislav. I feel like, yeah, it's more like brand perception than like real quality, because like, people are very subjective about like, things like that. And you can't really quantify like quality. And that's why it's more about like brand reputation. Some people know that this brand is cool, so they will buy it, they will be willing to pay more for it. Some brands consider it to be cheaper, even so it may produce similar like quality, but people just will not buy it because it's like on cheaper side. Right. It could be a lot of things. Style, comfort, safety, miles per gallon, show off to your friends, signal status. I want you to think in a larger context about the bundle of benefits a car can offer that you as a marketer would actually want to understand. Think about really kind of centering hashtag customer centricity here. So you've made some great suggestions. Measuring a lot of different things is difficult. You end up with so many dependent variables, it's hard to analyze all those at once. And so that is where data analysis technique such as PCA is helpful, because, you know, there are a lot of other factors. Analysis is being one technique, multi-dimensional scaling, hierarchical cluster analysis, these are all big, big words that represent big concepts and big technological tools. PCA is one of those. So what I want to ask you, it's got to be rhetorical at this point because we're out of time, is PCA is a really helpful tool to marketers. But let's ensure that we're asking the right questions and that we're demonstrating the correct variables in a perceptual map. We looked at that in Activity 1 in quite great detail and really fine-tuned that craft, which like I promised you'll be utilizing the rest of your careers. But really using PCA as a way to uncover these in the data and then saying, actually I've got to recalibrate and I've got to ask different questions because as a marketer, maybe the high correlation shows me that that was less helpful. And so always be intuitive when you apply these practices. All right, good work everybody. Here's your last reflection poll, five minutes here. I'll add an extra three minutes on for those who want extra time to take this. Good work. Thank you. you you you you you you you you you Good work everybody. Feel free to drop off if you're done. Three more minutes for those who want extra time. Bye guys. Have a good weekend. We'll talk soon. Good luck with the submission. you you you you what you two minutes you you you okay Mohammed Can you hear me? Yeah, so actually I have a question about the assignment because I'm kind of confused in specific parts. For example, it's mentioned that we in the segmentation part, we should try to create segments that are homogeneous internally and heterogeneous across segments. Can you explain this? Sorry, let me pull it up. Trying to find this explanation. Vlad, did you want to hop in on Mohammed's? Yeah, it just means messy. First is they don't overlap. Right. So for example, if you take one segment that's age 20 to 25 and the other segment also has 25 to 30, then they overlap. That's not good. So first criteria is that they cannot overlap based on the variables. And second is they need to sum up to 100%. So if you take the sum of your segments, like segment one, 30% segment to 50%. So like if they sum up to more than 100%, that's also wrong. Like they need to sum up exactly to 100%. I think, please correct me, Professor, if I got it wrong. But I think that's the logic. No, yeah, that's exactly right. Is that the question you were asking? Mohammed? Yeah, so I mean, I think this takes a lot of time. Actually, it takes both parts. Yeah. Thank you, Vlad. I have one more question, which is in part one, we should just go with the calculations and do the correlation and all of this stuff. And then we'll go to our segmentation. And from here, we should explain the market research or comment on the market research in question nine. And then jump to our analysis, right? And part two. So for the market analysis, or the market research, should we tackle why we specifically introduce the segments related to this market research and then go to our analysis, which is basically explaining how can we make another hypothesis relating to the importance of these segments? Or should we tackle it in a different way? I think it's you're overcomplicating it a bit. I mean, in essence, you answer one through eight in part one, part two is really where you're getting clear on the segmentation, and you're responding exactly to all these questions, right? So as enumerated here, does the study present to do a good job of evaluating consumer attitudes, strengths and weaknesses of the present approach, etc, etc. And we've totally revamped that this and made it much more explicit, because in the past, we had too many different sort of interpretations of how to go about that. And so I think if you just simply respond to these questions in part two, you'll be just fine. Okay, perfect. But what does this mean to analyze the entire market research? Just basically elaborate on all the questions again and how the market research happens there and how they conduct the survey? Correct. Yes, correct. Okay, thank you so much. Just one more thing away from the assignment. I sent your professor an email and also too many emails. I think one was in the beginning of the semester talking about specific poll and the previous email was about the assignment. Yes, yes, I'll get a chance to do that. Like I said, I usually don't change those, but I'm happy to look over it. And yeah, I will do that in the next week. Okay, thank you so much. You're welcome. Vlad, Teddy, do you guys have any questions or comments? Yeah, I'm just a bit confused about what to do with question nine, because here it says ignore the problem in question nine. Instead, analyze the entire market research process, instead analyze the entire market research process, blah, blah, blah. Is this saying that like completely ignore the prompt and just move on to part two? Or does it mean that instead of question nine, we need to do something else? Yeah, I mean, Vlad sort of spoke to that in your email. Mohamed just sort of raised that. It is a bit confusing, isn't it, how that's worded? Yes, one through eight is part one. Part two is, you know, getting more clear on segmentation schemes as asked in those different enumerated questions. Yeah, we'll clarify that. I'm going to have them essentially just drop that last sentence going forward. Vlad? I have one question about segmentation. And the second question about critic critique. Now, starting from segmentation, I spent quite a while trying to segment the data set by two variables, and three variables. And I really tried, but they didn't sum up to 100% in the end, at all. I tried quite a few combinations. And I realized that then the easiest is just to segment by one variable, for example, just annual income, or just their purchases, or just one simple variable. And then do it by quintiles, or something like that, like equally split them into almost equal parts. And it works, like it's much easier, it's much more straightforward, and it works. And so my question here is, I felt so lost in the process of trying to derive the segmentation, like, because we didn't study that. So my question is, what are the approaches for specifically segmenting that massive data set, based on two or three variables? Like, on one variable, I know, we can just take quintiles. But based on two or three variables, how would you even approach it? Is there an algorithm for that? Or is it much more simple than I'm thinking? It's much more simple than you're thinking, but I can't give that information away per assignment. We can discuss it after, though. Yeah, I will be happy to discuss after then. All right. And then the second question is, I'm drafting a plan for critique, for what to critique in the paper parts where we write text. And there are quite a lot of potential ideas. We can critique the sampling, we can critique, I don't know how representative it is, we can critique the bias, like the biases that we studied, that creep into this process, potentially, about this whole survey methodology. So a lot of that research design part. But there is really no right way or no specific expectation of what specifically we should focus on, right? We can focus on whatever we feel like is important here. Not necessarily, yes. Whatever you deem most important, based on the objectives of the study.
